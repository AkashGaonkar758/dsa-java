## Overview

The repository includes the implementation of various data structures and algorithms to facilitate learning and practice. Each file is self-contained and demonstrates a specific concept. These implementations are not optimized for production but aim to help you understand the logic and underlying principles.

## Files and Implementations

### Data Structures

- **Linked Lists**
  - `SinglyLinkedList.java`: Singly linked list implementation.
  - `DoublyLinkedList.java`: Doubly linked list implementation.
  - `DoubleEndedLinkedList.java`: Double-ended linked list implementation.
  - `Node.java`: Node class with data and a pointer for singly linked lists.
  - `Node2.java`: Node class with data and two pointers for doubly linked lists.

- **Stack and Queue**
  - `LStack.java`: Stack implementation using linked lists.
  - `Stack.java`: Array-based stack implementation.
  - `LQueue.java`: Queue implementation using linked lists.
  - `Queue.java`: Array-based queue implementation.

- **Sorted List**
  - `SortedList.java`: Implementation of a sorted linked list where elements are inserted in sorted order. It includes methods to check if the list is empty, add elements while maintaining order, remove the head element, and display the list.

### Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - `BubbleSort.java`: Bubble sort algorithm.
  - `InsertionSort.java`: Insertion sort algorithm.
  - `SelectionSort.java`: Selection sort algorithm.
  - `MergeSort.java`: Merge sort algorithm.
  - `QuickSort.java`: Quick sort algorithm.
  - `ShellSort.java`: Shell sort algorithm.

- **Search Algorithms**
  - `BinarySearch.java`: Iterative binary search implementation.
  - `RecursiveBinarySearch.java`: Recursive binary search implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 8 or higher)
- A Java IDE or text editor of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-in-java.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dsa-in-java
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE or compile it using the terminal.

## Usage
